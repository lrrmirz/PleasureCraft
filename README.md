## Core Features & Mechanics

* **Seasonal Events:** The heart of PleasureCraft is its seasonal events.  These are dynamic additions that significantly alter the landscape and gameplay based on time of year.  Events introduce new structures, flora, fauna, and even opportunities for romantic encounters.  Think of it as a constantly evolving game world.
* **Dynamic Structures:**  Instead of static structures, PleasureCraft introduces dynamic structures that react to player actions and time.  For example, a bonfire might ignite on a successful romantic encounter, or a field might bloom with wildflowers after a long day of building.
* **Relationship System:**  A sophisticated relationship system is built into the mod, allowing players to build relationships with each other and with other NPCs.  These relationships are not just about romance; they're about shared experiences and collaborative building.
* **Customizable Interface:**  Players can customize their interface to reflect their preferred relationship style - ranging from minimalist to elaborate.  This includes options for displaying relationships, building blocks, and even custom elements.
* **Color Palettes:**  A wide variety of color palettes are available, allowing players to personalize the look of their builds and relationships.

## Key Components & Modules

* **Flower Fields:**  A huge expansion introducing a dynamic flower field system.  The flowers bloom and wither based on the time of day and player interactions, creating a beautiful and constantly changing aesthetic.
